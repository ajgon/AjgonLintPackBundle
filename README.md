# Symfony AjgonLintPackBundle

# Installation

## 1. Using Composer (recommended)

To install `LintPackBundle` with [Composer][1] just add the following to
your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    // ...
    "require": {
        // ...
        "ajgon/lint-pack": "1.2.*@dev"
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

Then, you can install the new dependencies by running Composer's update command
from the directory where your `composer.json` file is located:

```sh
$ php composer.phar update ajgon/lint-pack
```

Now, Composer will automatically download all required files, and install them
for you. All that is left to do is to update your `AppKernel.php` file, and
register the new bundle:

```php
<?php
// in AppKernel::registerBundles()
$bundles = array(
    // ...
    new Ajgon\LintPackBundle\LintPackBundle(),
    // ...
);
```

```sh
$ php app/console
...
lint
  lint:all                              Lint all files with all linters
  lint:csslint                          Lint all files with csslint
  lint:jshint                           Lint all files with jshint
  lint:phpcpd                           Lint all files with phpcpd
  lint:phpcs                            Lint all files with phpcs
  lint:phpmd                            Lint all files with phpmd
  lint:twigviews                        Lint all files with twig linters
